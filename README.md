<h1>Background Color and Text Image Generator</h1>

<p>This Python script generates images with different background colors and text colors, and saves them as PNG files. It is useful for generating materials for image processing tasks or testing color combinations. I've created this script for the SUAS Competition</p>

<h2><strong><font color="red">WARNING:</font></strong></h2>
<p>Be Careful! Don't write 'Desktop' as the save location or your desktop will be freeze. When it happen, you can delete this files from Desktop folders in the Users folder</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>The script works by iterating through predefined lists of background colors, text colors, and materials (letters and numbers). For each combination of background color and text color, it generates an image with the specified material/text, places the text in the center, and saves the image as a PNG file.</p>
